### LLM is a brain 
|
|--> **Basically it only possess knowledge** 
|    It can understand natural language and give textual response.
|    The LLM can perform "Sentiment Analysis" and understand the context of data it was trained on.
|    It cannot perform tasks. 
|    It cannot access internet.
|    It possesses "world knowledge"("duniya jahan ki knowledge") derived from the|massive datasets 
|    Despite its intelligence, the "Brain" cannot perform tasks. 
|
|--> **AGENT**
|    Instead of just chatting, LLM is given a "System Prompt" that instructs it to Plan, Act and 
|      Observe
|
|    When a user asks, "What is the sum of the weather in Patiala and Mohali?", the LLM's intelligence 
|    breaks this down. It realizes it cannot answer immediately, so it plans to call a specific tool 
|    (getWeatherDetails) for Patiala, waits for the result, and then plans to call it again for Mohali
|    
|    The Formula: LLM + Tools = AI Agent
|    
|    An autonomous system that uses an LLM to plan and execute tasks using available tools, rather than 
|    just chatting
|
|    We give context of functions that developer has assigned and this mechanism of feeding this 
|    context to model is called as auto-prompting
